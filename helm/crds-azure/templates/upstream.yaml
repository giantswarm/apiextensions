With cluster-api as a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.

Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.

With cluster-api as a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.

FailureReason will be populated with a succinct value suitable for machine interpretation, while FailureMessage will contain a more verbose string suitable for logging and human consumption. \n These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured. \n Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the controller's output."

                description: "UseExperimentalRetryJoin replaces a basic kubeadm command with a shell script with retries for joins. \n This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to kubeadm proper and use that functionality. \n This will add about 40KB to userdata \n For more information, refer to https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/2763#discussion_r397306055."
